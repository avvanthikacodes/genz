## Basic Details
### Team Name: PJ Codes BCM


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Adhwaith J - st. joseph college devagiri

### Project Description
Paste a formal paragraph or assignment topic. it translates into absolute Gen Z Slang.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Formal text is boring af. We just wanna say " Bro it rained like hell" instead of " Due to recent weather conditions.."
wheres the vibe eh.. wheres the fire! We need a translator for Gen Z Brains.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We made a translator that  turns boring school stuff into absolute bro gibberish.
it solves nothing, but sounds hilarious.
